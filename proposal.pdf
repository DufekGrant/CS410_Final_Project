This project will fall under the Theme 1 category of Intelligent browsing. The topic involves the creation of a browser extension in which the user can enter a word or sequence of words, and the extension will retrieve a ranked output of relevant passages from the document. This ranker extension solves the problem of normal word retrieval from web browsing simply relying upon ctrl+F, which only allows the user to look for an exact keyword in a document. This topic relates to the theme of Intelligent Browsing as it gives the user a more thorough and robust method to find relevant information for their document browsing needs. Intelligent Browsing is a cornerstone of Text Information Systems and is instrumental in the theme of the class.

This project will involve the implementation of a BM25 derivation for ranking as well as techniques to judge string similarity. In order to demonstrate that the approach will work as intended, the extension will be tested for its ability to retrieve relevant passages from a curated test set and scored accordingly as well as the extension itself being physically usable. Implementation of the extension will rely upon the programming languages Javascript and Python.
